## What is Markdown?

**Markdown** is a markup language that let's me write plain text documents with a lightweight formatting options. (It's a simple way to make text look organized without fancy software. ) Instead of clicking bold or underline buttons, I just type special symbols.

## What is Git?

**Git** is a version control system. It's like a time machine for files.

- It keep tracks of all the changes I make so I can always go back if I mess something up.
- If more than one person is working on the same project, Git makes sure nobody overwrite someone
- Can also think of it as a "Save history"
